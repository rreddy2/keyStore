Distributed Systems Programming Assignment 4


We implemented the key-value store with configurable consistency with Python

How to compile and run on remote.cs computers:
	1.	create a text file with all of the information (<replica-name> <ip-address> <port-number>)
	2.	open up 4 remote.cs terminals and run ./replica.py <replica-name> <port-number> <replicas.txt> on
		each of them
	3.	start a client on a 5th terminal with ./client <ip-address> <port-number> with the coordinator's IP 
		address and port number.
	4.	open up the console and write "get" and "put" methods

Brian worked on:
	Planning out the whole project from start to finish
	Did Hinted Handoff and Read Repair
	Client => Coordinator message implementation
	Threading and Coordination between Replicas
Rohith worked on:
	Planning out the whole project from start to finish
	Worked on write-ahead log implementation and replica restart
	Client.py
	Get and Put Functions in ReplicaServer.py
	Protobuff File
Completion Status:
	We have completed the whole assignment. All implementations including replicas, clients, read repair, hinted handoff,
	replication factor, write-ahead log, and configurable consistency.
